This App started as my last project of the SPICED Web Development Bootcamp. Now after graduation I am step by step trying to implement new functionalities.
Current functionalities include:
1) Creating and deleting To-Do lists, inserting tasks and to-do's, which can be ticked off as done, which will trigger a randomised motivational message.
2) Pomodoro timer with work time and break time, each adjustable to desired times. After each timer runs out, it will trigger a sound for break time and work time.
